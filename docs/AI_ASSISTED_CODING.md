# AI-assisted coding guardrails

AI assistance accelerates implementation, but increases risk of subtle errors.

## Operational rules
- Treat AI output as untrusted until verified.
- Require tests or executable checks for behavior changes.
- Prefer small diffs.
- Keep domain assumptions explicit.

## Minimum acceptance for AI-authored changes
- Clear intent and verification criteria.
- Minimal, reviewable patch set.
- Updated tests/policy checks when applicable.
- Brief verification report.
