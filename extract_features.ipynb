    "\n",
    "This takes: \n",
    "- a specification 'assessment_template.xlsx' that has a column identifying each piece of information you'd like to assess for in the transcript. This file must be in an ASSESSMENT_DIR, which is where the output will be written. Each sheet in the assessment_template should have information features pertinent to a single diagnosis (e.g. Cardiac chest pain, esophageal dysphagia, etc.)\n",
    "- a folder that contains all the transcripts (TRANSCRIPT_DIR)\n",
    "\n",
    "The script then extracts the text from each transcripts and feeds it to an LLM, asking it to evaluate whether each piece of information was assessed by the doctor, and if so whether they patient responded that it was present or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "It then feeds the response text to an LLM, reformats it, and outputs it back to a new excel spreadsheet. "

    "    lr_prompt = \"\"\"You are an expert diagnostician who is explaining to a trainee which pieces of information they should pay attention to during the diagnostic process. Your task is to summarize how strong of evidence the presence or absence of a particular new finding is for whether a patient has a disease. For example, if a patient has chest pain and the EKG show ST segment elevations, this is STRONG evidence that the chest pain is due to a heart attack. If the patient has t-wave inversions, this is WEAKER evidence in favor - because t-wave changes are not as specific for cardiac causes of chest pain. If they have known heartburn, this is WEAK absence against (because it’s an explanation, but it IS possible to have a history of heartburn but have a heart attack). Lastly, if they are a young female without an inherited condition, this is STRONG evidence against a cardiac cause because that demographic almost never has heart attacks. Lastly, if the piece of information is unhelpful, it would be called neutral. For example, if the patient has blue eyes irrelevant to the cause of chest pain, thus it would be NEUTRAL. \n",
    "\n",
    "    I’d like you to follow the following steps:\n",
    "        1.\tConsider, what does the finding mean about what is going on with the patient?\n",
    "        2.\tdoes the presence of the new information make the disease more or less likely? Or no difference?\n",
    "        3.\tDoes the finding make another cause of the same symptom more common? If so, then by definition it makes the target condition a less likely explanation.\n",
    "        4.\tOnce you’ve decided whether the finding makes the diagnosis more or less likely, use the following scale to come up with a response:\n",
    "\n",
    "        •\tIf knowing the piece of information makes the odds of the diagnosis more than 1.95x higher than it was before, it is a STRONG POSITIVE finding\n",
    "        •\tIf knowing the piece of information makes the odds of the diagnosis 1.18x to 1.95x higher than it was before, it is a WEAK POSITIVE finding\n",
    "        •\tIf knowing the piece of information makes changes the odds only 0.92x to 1.18x as likely as it was before, then it is a NEUTRAL finding\n",
    "        •\tIf knowing the piece of information makes the odds of the diagnosis 0.72x to 0.92x times as likely as it was before, then it is a WEAK NEGATIVE finding.\n",
    "        •\tIf knowing the piece of information makes the odds of the diagnosis less than 0.72x higher than it was before, it is a STRONG POSITIVE\n",
    "\n",
    "    As another example, say I’m wondering whether a patient with GI bleeding has a lower GI bleed (below the ligament of Treitz) or an upper GI bleed. The presence of clots in the blood is a very strong predictor of lower GI bleeding, because bleeding from the stomach cannot form clots due to the stomach acid. You should use all physiologic clues to whether a piece of information is a STRONG, WEAK, or NEUTRAL predictor. \n",
    "\n",
    "    You will receive inputs in the following format; Target condition: <Condition, e.g. Cardiac chest pain>. Finding: <piece of information, e.g. ‘No radiation to the neck, arm, or jaw’>.\n",

    "    STRONG POSITIVE, WEAK POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, WEAK NEGATIVE, STRONG NEGATIVE.\n",

    "    Here are some examples:\n",
    "    Prompt = Target condition: Cardiac Chest Pain. Finding: Pain not worse with exertion (requires they clarify exercise 1hr after meal).\n",
    "    You would reason that because cardiac chest pain is usually worse with exertion because exertion worsens cardiac demand for oxygen, and thus worsens ischemia.\n",

    "    }\n",
    "\n",
