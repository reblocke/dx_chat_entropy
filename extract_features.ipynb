    "\n",
    "This takes: \n",
    "- a specification 'assessment_template.xlsx' that has a column identifying each piece of information you'd like to assess for in the transcript. This file must be in an ASSESSMENT_DIR, which is where the output will be written. Each sheet in the assessment_template should have information features pertinent to a single diagnosis (e.g. Cardiac chest pain, esophageal dysphagia, etc.)\n",
    "- a folder that contains all the transcripts (TRANSCRIPT_DIR)\n",
    "\n",
    "The script then extracts the text from each transcripts and feeds it to an LLM, asking it to evaluate whether each piece of information was assessed by the doctor, and if so whether they patient responded that it was present or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "It then feeds the response text to an LLM, reformats it, and outputs it back to a new excel spreadsheet. "
