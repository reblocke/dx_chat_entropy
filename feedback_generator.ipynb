    "In practice these processes —information gathering and reasoning— are interconnected, as reasoning guides the questions asked during an encounter.  However, separating the processes for feedback may help learners pinpoint areas for improvement. For now, feedback is only provided at the end, so we are limited to evaluating both processes based on the completed interview.\n",

    "#### Two different types of likelihood ratios\n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood ratio represents the relative information in favor of 1 hypothesis and against another. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the usual positive and negative likelihood ratios, the two hypothesis are: \n",
    "- H0 = Disease A is present\n",
    "- H1 = Disease A is not present\n",
    "And therefore, the LR summarizes the evidence for the disease and against *everything else*\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you are reasoning about a constraint set of diagnoses - say, disease A and disease B - and you know that it's 1 but not both of the two diseases that explains the presentation... then the information can be summarized by whats been called a \"differential\" likelihood ratio: \n",
    "- H0 = Disease A is present (and disease B is not present) \n",
    "- H1 = Disease B is present (and disease A is not present) \n",
    "And then the LR_differential summarizes the amount that a piece of evidence supports Disease A over Disease B. \n",
    "(from https://academic.oup.com/book/31795/chapter/266181309?login=false)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ample data exists on overall likelihood ratios (however, it should be noted that for an estimate of an overall LR to apply, both the spectrum of Disease A and the spectrum of not disease A cases must be similar - see https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4916916/ )\n",
