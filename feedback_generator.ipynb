    "In practice these processes —information gathering and reasoning— are interconnected, as reasoning guides the questions asked during an encounter.

    "In the usual positive and negative likelihood ratios, the two hypothesis are: \n",

    "However, if you are reasoning about a constraint set of diagnoses - say, disease A and disease B - and you know that it's 1 but not both of the two diseases that explains the presentation... then the information can be summarized by whats been called a \"differential\" likelihood ratio: \n",
    "- H0 = Disease A is present (and disease B is not present) \n",
    "- H1 = Disease B is present (and disease A is not present) \n",
